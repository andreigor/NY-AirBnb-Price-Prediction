### Overview

Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. 
This dataset describes the listing activity and metrics in NYC, NY for 2019. In this project, we would like to recommend a reasonable price for its users,
in case those users are going to list proprieties to be rented at their platform, they already have a lot of useful data from previous and current customers.

Beyond just recomending a reasonable price, we are also interested in learning about what makes listings have a higher or lower price,
so its possible to provide a better exprience to different customer groups.
